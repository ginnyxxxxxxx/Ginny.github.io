<p style="font-size:20px;">I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science, at the University of Minnesota. My research interests include machine learning and spatiotemporal prediction. I received my bachelor's degree from Hefei University of Technology and my master's degree from the University of Science and Technology of China.</p>

<p style="font-size:20px;">I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Yao-Yi Chiang](https://yaoyichi.github.io/) of the [Knowledge Computing Lab](https://knowledge-computing.github.io/).</p>
