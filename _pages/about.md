#### I'm a first-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science, at the University of Minnesota. My research interests include machine learning and spatiotemporal prediction. I received my bachelor's degree from Hefei University of Technology and my master's degree from the University of Science and Technology of China.

#### I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Yao-Yi Chiang of the Knowledge Computing Lab.
